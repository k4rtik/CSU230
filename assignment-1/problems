# 1. Write a recursive function to print the numbers from 1 to 10.
# 2. Write a function to enter a string and display it in reverse. Donâ€™t use arrays or strings.
# 3.. Write a recursive function to find the GCD of two given numbers.
# 4. Write a recursive function to enter characters one by one until a space is entered. The function should return the depth at which the space was encountered.
# 5. Write a recursive function to generate the permutations of  a string of size n.
# 6. Write a Program to implement Binary search algorithm(Using both iterative and recursive approaches)
# 7. Write a progam to implement insertion sort.
# 8. Write a program to implement bubble sort.
# 9. Implement strcmp function using pointers

# 10. Write a pointer version of the function strcat

#11. Write a funtion strend(s,t) which returns 1 if the string t occurs at the end of the strings and zero  otherwise(using pointers)

# 12. Implement strncmp(s, t, n)which compares the first  n charactor of string s to t

#13. a) Write a C program that uses functions to perform the following operations:
i) To insert a sub-string in to given main string from a given position.
ii) To delete n Characters from a given position in a given string.

  b) insertion
  c) deletion
  d)  search

# 15. Implement following functins on a doubly linked list
  a) creation
  b) insertion
  c) deletion
  d)  search
